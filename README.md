# Smart-Disease-Predictor
A complete end-to-end Heart Disease Prediction System built using classical ML models, a custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Explainable AI (SHAP). This project performs full data analysis → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → interpretability → deployment with a Streamlit web app.
